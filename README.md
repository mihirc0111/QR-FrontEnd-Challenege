## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I made 2  divisions of image and content and put them in 1 big division Full-block.I made use of display:inline-block property to reduce the dimensions of bigger div to width:350px & height:540px.I used margin and border radius properties to make the webpage look like the question.

### Continued development

I would like to learn resposive webpage design which will not cause the design of webpage to distort when zoomed  in or out... which i will be learning in the upcoming udemy modules.
